Plan your train journeys more flexibly than is possible with traditional apps.

## Download

Currently, no packages are provided. To use Journey Planner,
you have to download the source code and build it yourself (see below).

## Building

Since Journey Planner is built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev),
you first have to [set up the flutter toolchain](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
Then, building the app is as simple as running

```sh
flutter build apk
```

## Project Status

Journey Planner is currently an early preview for everyone interested to try out,
give feedback and maybe make suggestions on the direction of the development.
